## Awesome official statistics software [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
An awesome list of open source statistical software packages useful for creating and accessing official statistics.


#### An item on this list is awesome because

1. it is free, open source, and available for download;
2. it is confirmed to be used in the production of official statistics by at least one institute, or
3. it provides access to official statistics publications.

We prefer packages that are reasonably easy to install and use and that
are actively maintained.

[Contributions](#contributions) are welcome.
