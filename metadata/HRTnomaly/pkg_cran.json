To correct for outliers, micro edits are\nmanually performed on all records. A set of constraints and decision rules\nis typically used to aid the editing process. However, straightforward\ndecision rules might overlook anomalies arising from disruption of linear\nrelationships. Computationally efficient methods are provided to\nidentify historical, tail, and relational anomalies at the data-entry\nlevel (Sartore et al., 2024; <doi:10.6339/24-JDS1136>). A score statistic\nis developed for each anomaly type, using a distribution-free approach\nmotivated by the Bienaymé-Chebyshev's inequality, and fuzzy logic is used\nto detect cellwise outliers resulting from different types of anomalies.\nEach data entry is individually scored and individual scores are combined\ninto a final score to determine anomalous entries. In contrast to fuzzy\nlogic, Bayesian bootstrap and a Bayesian test based on empirical\nlikelihoods are also provided as studied by Sartore et\nal. (2024; <doi:10.3390/stats7040073>). These algorithms allow for a more\nnuanced approach to outlier detection, as it can identify outliers at\ndata-entry level which are not obviously distinct from the rest of the\ndata.\n---\nThis research was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,\nNational Agriculture Statistics Service.
