The central function\ncalculate_price_index() offers a unified interface for running these methods\non structured datasets. This package is designed to support index construction\nworkflows for real estate and other domains where quality-adjusted price\ncomparisons over time are essential. The development of this package was funded\nby Eurostat and Statistics Netherlands (CBS), and carried out by Statistics Netherlands.\nThe HMTS method implemented here is described in Ishaak, Ouwehand and Rem√∏y (2024)\n<doi:10.1177/0282423X241246617>.
