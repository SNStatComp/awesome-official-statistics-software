{"Package":"R2BEAT","Type":"Package","Title":"Multistage Sampling Allocation and Sample Selection","Description":"Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains in one and two stages stratified sample design. 'R2BEAT' extends the Neyman (1934) – Tschuprow (1923) allocation method to the case of several variables, adopting a generalization of the Bethel’s proposal (1989). 'R2BEAT' develops this methodology but, moreover, it allows to determine the sample allocation in the multivariate and multi-domains case of estimates for two-stage stratified samples. It also allows to perform both Primary Stage Units and Secondary Stage Units selection. This package requires the availability of 'ReGenesees', that can be installed from <https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees>.","Version":"1.0.5","Depends":{"R":">= 3.5.0","sampling":"*","glue":"*","methods":"*","parallel":"*","foreach":"*","doParallel":"*"},"Suggests":{"ReGenesees":"*"},"Author":"Andrea Fasulo,Giulio Barcaroli,Stefano Falorsi,Alessio Guandalini,Daniela Pagliuca,Marco Dionisio Terribili","Maintainer":"Andrea Fasulo <fasulo@istat.it>","License":"EUPL","Encoding":"UTF-8","URL":"https://barcaroli.github.io/R2BEAT/","BugReports":"https://github.com/barcaroli/R2BEAT/issues","RoxygenNote":"7.1.1","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2023-05-25 09:18:28 UTC; Giulio","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2023-05-25 10:20:06 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2023-05-25 11:45:23","MD5sum":"94c8b8df85851540b50dadc77a8d2e2a","date":"2023-05-25T09:20:06+00:00","releases":[]}
