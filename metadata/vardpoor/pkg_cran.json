I: Methods and Applications; vol. II: Theory. 1953, New York: John Wiley and Sons), variance estimation for longitudinal, cross-sectional measures and measures of change for single and multistage stage cluster sampling designs (Berger, Y. G., 2015, <doi:10.1111/rssa.12116>). Several other precision measures are derived - standard error, the coefficient of variation, the margin of error, confidence interval, design effect.","URL":"https://csblatvia.github.io/vardpoor/,\nhttps://github.com/CSBLatvia/vardpoor/","BugReports":"https://github.com/CSBLatvia/vardpoor/issues/","License":"EUPL","Encoding":"UTF-8","Language":"en-GB","Repository":"CRAN","NeedsCompilation":"no","RoxygenNote":"7.3.3","Packaged":"2026-01-28 07:58:01 UTC; lroze","Author":"Juris Breidaks [aut],\nMartins Liberts [aut],\nJelena Voronova [cre],\nSanta Ivanova [aut],\nAleksis Jursevskis [ctb],\nAnthony Damico [ctb],\nLiliana Roze [ctb],\nCentral Statistical Bureau of Latvia [cph, fnd]","Maintainer":"Jelena Voronova <jelena.voronova@csp.gov.lv>","Date/Publication":"2026-01-29 08:30:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2026-01-29 09:24:15","MD5sum":"7ae3f0d2b63bd3388de66efa96ff857f","date":"2026-01-29T07:30:02+00:00","releases":[]}
