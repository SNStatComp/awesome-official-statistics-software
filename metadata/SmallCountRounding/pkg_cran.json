The function PLSrounding() performs small count rounding of necessary inner cells so that all small frequencies of cross-classifications to be published (publishable cells) are rounded. This is equivalent to changing micro data since frequencies of unique combinations are changed. Thus, additivity and consistency are guaranteed.
