These indexes can then be chained\ntogether to form a time series that gives the evolution of prices with\nrespect to a fixed base period. This package contains a collection of\nfunctions that revolve around this work flow, making it easy to build\nstandard price indexes, and implement the methods described by\nBalk (2008, <doi:10.1017/CBO9780511720758>), von der Lippe (2007,\n<doi:10.3726/978-3-653-01120-3>), and the CPI manual (2020,\n<doi:10.5089/9781484354841.069>) for bilateral price indexes.","Depends":{"R":">= 4.1"},"Imports":{"stats":"*","utils":"*","gpindex":">= 0.6.2","Matrix":">= 1.5-0"},"Suggests":{"data.tree":"*","knitr":"*","rmarkdown":"*","sps":"*","testthat":">= 3.0.0","treemap":"*"},"License":"MIT + file LICENSE","Encoding":"UTF-8","URL":"https://marberts.github.io/piar/, https://github.com/marberts/piar","BugReports":"https://github.com/marberts/piar/issues","LazyData":"true","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Config/testthat/edition":"3","RoxygenNote":"7.3.2","NeedsCompilation":"no","Packaged":"2025-09-17 03:54:03 UTC; steve","Author":"Steve Martin [aut, cre, cph] (ORCID:\n<https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2544-9480>)","Maintainer":"Steve Martin <marberts@protonmail.com>","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2025-09-17 04:10:02 UTC","crandb_file_date":"2025-09-17 04:51:36","MD5sum":"e090c764f3a11dfe7803b191a250cbc8","date":"2025-09-17T03:10:02+00:00","releases":[]}
