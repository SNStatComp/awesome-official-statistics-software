The central function\ncalculate_price_index() offers a unified interface for running these methods\non structured datasets. This package is designed to support index construction workflows across a wide range of domains\n— including but not limited to real estate — where quality-adjusted price comparisons over time are essential.\nThe development of this package was funded by Eurostat and Statistics Netherlands (CBS), and carried out by Statistics Netherlands.\nThe HMTS method implemented here is described in Ishaak, Ouwehand and Remøy (2024)\n<doi:10.1177/0282423X241246617>.
